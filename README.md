# Genetic Algorithm to find a goal sentence from a random one
## Rafael Cartenet / Maxime Aberton / Killian Jaubert


Developped in C++ within the INSA's C++ course where the goal was to get familiar with C++

Using a real simple distance method to compare the difference between two sentences, we developped a simple genetic algorithm in order to get close to a given target sentence.  
The goal of this project was mainly to get in touched with C++ and genetic Algorithm
